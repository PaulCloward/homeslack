        <h3>Spending thousands on a realtor</h3>
        <h4>Sure, you can list your home with a realtor, or you can keep thousands of dollars in your pocket. You decide. 
          <br><br>
          Traditional realtor fees are 6% and paid completely by the seller from the proceeds of the home. That is $12,000 on a $200,000 home that you could be keeping in your own pocket. That isn't even including your seller's closing costs! 
          <br><br>
          With Kuldasac, you pay nothing to sell your home. It is completely free. Sound too good to be true? It's not. All costs associated with the selling and buying of your home (think closing costs, title, renovations, etc.) are paid by our qualified investors.
